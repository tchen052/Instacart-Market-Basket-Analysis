### Problem Statement
Donorschoose.org is a US-based nonprofit crowdfunding platform whose mission is to help mitigate the impact of a vastly underfunded American school system through direct donations to individual classroom projects. Since its inception in 2000, DonorsChoose.org has raised over $685 million and supported three-quarters of all public schools in the U.S, making DonorsChoose.org the leading platform for supporting public education. 

However, teachers in the US still spend over a billion dollars funding their classroom and students' needs. To get students what they need to learn, the team at DonorsChoose.org needs to be able to connect donors with the projects that most inspire them.


#### Hypothesis/assumptions
The hypothesis is that donors largely choose projects to fund based on some degree of personal investment. 
#### Goals and success metrics
The goals are to: <br>
> 1. understand who donates <br>
> 2. understand and rank the signals donors consider when choosing projects to fund <br>
> 3. help Donorschoose.org extend its mission by matching donors to projects that interest them <br>
> 4. predict and measure repeated giving by existing donors, enabling Donorschoose.org to build more targeted outreach campaigns
#### Limitations 
Although we are looking into trends over all forms of giving, doing a separate analysis on existing repeat donors could provide a lot of insight. A potential limitation is that our sample of repeat donors is significantly smaller than that of single donors. 
#### Data Source 
The data used for this study was obtained from Kaggle and supplied by Donorschoose.org. I will be using anonymized data on donor giving from the past five years.
