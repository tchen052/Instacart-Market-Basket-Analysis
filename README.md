### Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to improve Instacart's in-app recommendation feature by predicting likelihood that a user will buy again, try a product for the first time, or add to cart next during a session.
The applications of this project are abundant. Apart from improving targeting on the Instacart site, having a better grasp of products that are being purchased and when can also help Instacart strengthen its relationships with retail partners by supplementing insight into inventory planning. 


#### Hypothesis/assumptions
The hypothesis is that previous buying behavior predicts future buying behavior. 
Product purchasing habits are a product of ___

#### Goals and success metrics
The goals are to: <br>
> 1. characterize repeat users of Instacart <br>
> 2. segment and characterize purchase behaviors based on time/day <br>
> 3. segment and understand the kinds of products that are purchased <br>
> 4. predict and measure repeated purchase by existing users, enabling Donorschoose.org to build more targeted recommendations
#### Limitations 
We are currently unable to characterize Instacart users as all personal user data are anonymized, and the data includes orders across many different retailers. The most we can uncover using the given dataset is segmented by time/date of purchase. The dataset provided represents a subset of Instacart's production data, which may be heavily biased. One example of this bias is that orders per customer are limited to 4-100 orders per customer. 

#### Data Source 
The data used for this study was obtained from Kaggle and supplied by Instacart. I will be using anonymized data of purchase patterns of different users to test: given the prior order metadata on products that were reordered, predict the products that will be reordered in these new orders.
