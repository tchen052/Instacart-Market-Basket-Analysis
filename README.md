# Snazzy Tech Startup Sounding Name

Here's some snazzy [project code names](https://royal.pingdom.com/the-developer-obsession-with-code-names-186-interesting-examples/)

### Note
The directory follows the layout from "A Quick Guide to Organizing Computational Biology Projecs" by William Stafford Noble.

We have sub-folders for docs: primarily papers; ipynb: which contains subfolders like EDA, with notebooks organized into chronological order; data: where all data files should live; src: any helper or utility files; and results: notebooks which contain any final pipelines or models, both in serialized Pickle for or in notebooks which can be replicated.

### Also note:
Your first step upon cloning this repo should be to create a folder called "data."
If you check out the `.gitignore` there's a line to block those folders, just so we don't try to push into github and run into issues with the 100 mb limit.
